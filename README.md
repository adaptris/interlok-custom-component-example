# service-example
A quick start to writing your own services.

* Uses maven to do the build.
* `mvn package`

Note: Our preferred way is to use [gradle](https://github.com/adaptris/interlok-custom-component-example/tree/gradle) as the build tool; So you may find this branch out of date and unloved (it is just an example of what you can do, if you choose maven).
